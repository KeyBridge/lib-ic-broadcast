Industry Canada BDBS Broadcast Data Extract (AM-FM-TV)
======================================================

This data source provides a cleaned and normalized version of the Industry Canada Broadcast (AM-FM-TV) database system, commonly called BDBS.

The BDBS database provides programmatic access to technical details for all licensed AM, FM, TV and SDAR transmitters approved for operation within Canada.

Data on applications under consideration is considered confidential by Industry Canada and is not available.

Background
---------- 
For purposes of protecting Canadian TV stations (serving locations wholly within Canada) from interference from unlicensed TV bands transmitting devices (TV white space devices), the TV white space database systems are to use Canadian TV station engineering data from Industry Canada’s licensing system rather than the Canadian records in the Commission’s Consolidated Database System (CDBS). (The Canadian station records in the CDBS contain data for internationally coordinated TV station agreements, which may not reflect actual station operations.)
